# CS300-Analysis-and-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

With project one performing the various data structures in terms of their own runtime and memory usage. By studying the preformance of these data structures I was able to determine a deeper understanding o fmy weaknesses and strengths. Like for example one of my main weaknesses was getting a better understanding of the Big-O natation. As for project two, This project required students to use various data structures and algorithms to sort the list of courses and to print them out in the desired order. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In Project One, the roadblock was understanding the implementation details of various data structures, which was overcome by reviewing Zybooks, and researching online resources. As for project two, the roadblock was implementing the sorting algorithm correctly, which was overcome by breaking down the problem into smaller parts, testing each part separately, and then integrating them into a working solution.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I have  learned to consider the trade-offs between different data structures, such as their space and time complexity. This understanding has helped me to optimize my code for performance and memory usage.
Furthermore, working on these projects has reinforced the importance of testing and documentation in software development. Writing comprehensive tests ensures that the code is working as expected and helps to identify and resolve any issues quickly. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I have learned to refactor code for readability and maintainability, which is important for producing high-quality software. These skills will help me in my future projects and make my programs more maintainable, adaptable, and readable. Overall, working on the projects has been a valuable learning experience that has expanded my programming skills and improved my approach to writing software.
